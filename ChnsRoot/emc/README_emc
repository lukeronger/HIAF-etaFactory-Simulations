This folder contains the emc simulation and reconstruction classes.

How to:
    1.  Run the EMC simulation and reconstruction, script in "run_macro" folder. ( Before run it, make sure 1)source environment and 2)"make" in buildEicc successfully. )
            such as [ root -l 'run_sim_emc.C(10, 1, "test2.root")' ] (events, energy, filename)
    2.  Main EMC function description of run_sim.C script 
            Parameter file (no need to re-make after modification):
                TString EmcParFile = "./EmcParams.par";
            Load geometry file: 
                EmcDet->SetGeometryFileName("[ filename ]"); // default path location is /geometry
            Set the storage of intermediate data: (For a low level user, only MCTruth and Particle information are required.)
                EmcDet->SetPersistance(kFALSE); // Close this will siignificantly decrease the storage usage 
    3.  Geometry creation script.
            Create the geometry root file, and file is generated in /geometry:
                root -l [ script name ]
			Geometry parameters could be modified through "/emc/par/ParEmcDet.h".

Directory description:
    EmcMC:      The MC simulation of EmcMC.
    EmcReco:    The reconstruction class tasks.
    EmcGeometry:   The scripts to build the Emc detector, geometry rootfile as output.
    par:        The parameters file for geometry and construction.

Useful class/file description:
    .
        ConstFact:  Contain all the parameters class that will be loaded.
        ReadPar:    A general example of para reading class.
    EmcMC
        Emc:        Main class of MC simulation, including load Emc geometry, make sensitive detector and record the hit.
        Point:      The format of MC data set that relevant to "Emc" class output.
        Geo:        Not used now
        GeoPar:     Not used now
    EmcReco
        DigiTask:   Point->Digi; collect MC hit point to gather energy deposit in blocks.
        Digi:       DigiTask data set
        ClusterTask:    Digi->Cluster; Reconstruct all neighbour blocks energy to form clusters.
        Cluster:    ClusterTask data set
        ParticleTask:   Cluster->4-Momentum; Reconstruct the 4-Momentum of particle based on PID. If no PID information is acquired(now), photon/electron is assumed as default.
		Particle:	ParticleTask data set
    par (namespce)
